## 1. Executive Summary

LeanKG is a lightweight, local-first knowledge graph solution designed for developers who use AI-assisted coding tools. The primary purpose is to provide AI models with accurate, concise codebase context without scanning unnecessary code, avoiding context window dilution, and ensuring documentation stays up-to-date with business logic mapping.

Unlike heavy frameworks like Graphiti that require external databases (Neo4j) and cloud infrastructure, LeanKG runs entirely locally on macOS and Linux with minimal resource consumption. It automatically generates and maintains documentation while mapping business logic to the existing codebase.

## 2. Problem Statement

### 2.1 Current Pain Points

| Pain Point | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **Context Window Dilution** | AI tools scan entire codebases, including irrelevant files, wasting context window tokens |
| **Outdated Documentation** | Manual docs quickly become stale; AI receives wrong context |
| **Business Logic Disconnect** | No clear mapping between business requirements and code implementation |
| **Token Waste** | Redundant code scanning generates unnecessary token costs |
| **Poor Code Generation** | AI lacks accurate context, producing incorrect or suboptimal code |
| **Feature Transfer Difficulty** | Onboarding new developers requires extensive code exploration |

### 2.2 Why Graphiti Is Not Suitable

- Requires Neo4j or similar external database (operational complexity)
- LLM API calls required for every episode ingestion (ongoing costs)
- Memory-intensive entity resolution
- No embedded deployment option
- Cannot run offline (network required)

## 3. Product Overview

### 3.1 Product Name

**LeanKG** - Lightweight Knowledge Graph for AI-Assisted Development

### 3.2 Product Type

Local-first knowledge graph with CLI and MCP server interface

### 3.3 Core Value Proposition

LeanKG enables AI coding tools to understand exactly what they need—nothing more, nothing less. It provides precise codebase context, automatic documentation, and business logic mapping while running entirely locally with minimal resource usage.

### 3.4 Target Users

1. **Primary:** Developers using AI coding assistants (Cursor, OpenCode, Claude Code, Codex, Windsurf)
2. **Secondary:** Development teams wanting self-hosted codebase intelligence
3. **Tertiary:** Individual developers needing better AI code generation

## 6. Technical Architecture

### 6.1 Technology Stack

**Recommended Stack (Best Performance):**

| Component | Technology | Rationale |
|-----------|------------|-----------|
| Core Language | Rust | Single binary, excellent performance, memory safety |
| Database | KuzuDB | Embedded graph DB, native traversal, no external process |
| Code Parsing | tree-sitter | Efficient, multi-language support, mature Rust bindings |
| MCP Server | Custom Rust | Standard MCP protocol, optimal performance |
| CLI | Clap | Standard Rust CLI patterns |
| Web UI | Leptos / Axum | Rust web framework, WASM-compatible |
| Embeddings | Optional (local Ollama or cloud API) | For semantic search (Phase 2) |

**Alternative Stack (Faster MVP Development):**

| Component | Technology | Rationale |
|-----------|------------|-----------|
| Core Language | Go | Cross-platform, single binary, faster to develop |
| Database | libSQL (Turso) | Embedded, SQLite-compatible, mature Go bindings |
| Code Parsing | tree-sitter | Same efficient parser |
| MCP Server | Custom Go | Standard MCP protocol |
| CLI | Cobra | Standard Go CLI patterns |
| Web UI | HTMX + Go templates | Lightweight, no complex frontend |

**Why KuzuDB over SQLite for Graph:**
- Native graph data model (nodes/edges as first-class citizens)
- Optimized for traversal queries (BFS, DFS, path finding)
- 10-100x faster than recursive SQL queries for multi-hop traversal
- Embedded, no external process required
- Supports queries like "find all nodes within N hops"

### 6.2 Data Model

**Node Identity:** Uses qualified_name (`file_path::parent::name`) as natural key instead of UUID. Example: `src/utils.rs::MyStruct::new`.

```
CodeElement:
  - qualified_name: string (PK) - format: file_path::parent::name
  - type: file | function | class | import | export
  - name: string
  - file_path: string
  - line_start: int
  - line_end: int
  - language: string
  - parent_qualified: string (optional)
  - metadata: JSON

Relationship:
  - id: integer (PK, auto-increment)
  - source_qualified: string (FK)
  - target_qualified: string (FK)
  - type: imports | implements | calls | contains | exports | tested_by
  - metadata: JSON

BusinessLogic:
  - id: integer (PK, auto-increment)
  - element_qualified: string (FK)
  - description: string
  - user_story_id: string (optional)
  - feature_id: string (optional)

Document:
  - id: integer (PK, auto-increment)
  - title: string
  - content: string
  - file_path: string
  - generated_from: string[] (qualified_names)
  - last_updated: timestamp
```

## 7. Out of Scope (MVP)

The following features are explicitly out of scope for MVP:

1. **Vector embeddings / semantic search** - Rule-based only
2. **Cloud sync** - Fully local
3. **Multi-user / team features** - Single user only
4. **Advanced authentication** - Local token only
5. **Plugin system** - Future consideration
6. **Enterprise integrations** - Future consideration
7. **All programming languages** - MVP: Go, TS/JS, Python only
8. **AI-powered entity extraction** - Cloud LLM integration optional, rule-based default
